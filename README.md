# fetch-image

## Setup
Use any terminal and type
```
git clone https://github.com/Darshan-2021-11/fetch-image
make
```
to compile and run the program.

## Description
The project fetches image from [pollination.ai] after a prompt is given, stores it in the very same directory after fetching the image.

NOTE: You need to have the image folder beforehand to store images in that directory... otherwise errors will show up when attempting to save the response.
