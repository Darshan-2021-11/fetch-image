# fetch-image

## Setup

Use any terminal and type

```
git clone https://github.com/Darshan-2021-11/fetch-image
make
./fetchImage
```

to compile and run the program.

## Description

The project fetches image from [here](pollination.ai) after a prompt is given, stores it in the very same directory after fetching the image.

##NOTE: 

1. You need to have the image folder beforehand to store images in that directory... otherwise errors will show up when attempting to save the response.

2. The libraries are specifically build for x86_64 architecture and needed to be changed in order to compile on other platforms.
